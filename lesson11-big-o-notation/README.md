## Written Question (5 minutes)

What are some calculating shortcuts that you like to use in your daily life. What are some of your favorite short cuts in general.

In daily life, I often use mental math shortcuts like rounding numbers to make addition and subtraction easier. For example, adding 99 by thinking of it as 100 and then subtracting 1. Another favorite shortcut is using the distributive property for multiplication, such as breaking down 12 * 15 into (10 * 15) + (2 * 15). In general, I also rely on keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V for copy-pasting, and Ctrl+F to quickly find text in documents. These shortcuts save time and improve efficiency in both calculations and general tasks.

### Refresher in Big O Notation:

    Definition and significance in measuring the efficiency of algorithms.

    Big O Notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space requirements in terms of the input size. It provides a high-level understanding of the algorithm's efficiency and helps compare the performance of different algorithms.


Focus on constant time complexity (O(1)): Explain with examples like accessing a specific element in an array, checking if a stack is empty, etc.

Constant time complexity, denoted as O(1), means that the running time of an algorithm is independent of the input size. The operation takes the same amount of time regardless of the size of the input.

### Key Concepts:

Why constant time operations are critical for performance.

Constant time operations are crucial because they provide the fastest possible execution time, ensuring that the algorithm remains efficient even as the input size grows.

Contrast with other complexities like O(n), O(log n).

O(n): Linear time complexity, where the running time grows linearly with the input size. Example: Iterating through an array.
O(log n): Logarithmic time complexity, where the running time grows logarithmically with the input size. Example: Binary search in a sorted array.
