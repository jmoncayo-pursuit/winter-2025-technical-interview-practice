# Lesson 12: Stacks Continued

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

### Deep Dive into Stack Applications
a stack is an abctract data type that allows a users to push data, pop data from the most recent push, look at most recently pushed data, and check from emptiness / how many pieces of data are present. 

#### Balanced Symbols
Learn how stacks are used to determine if parentheses, brackets, and braces in a string are balanced.

#### Expression Evaluation
Explore how stacks assist in evaluating postfix expressions and converting between infix, prefix, and postfix notation.

#### Stack-Based Algorithms
Discover the use of stacks in algorithms like backtracking and depth-first search.

#### Performance Considerations
Understand the time complexity and memory usage of stack operations.

- [Memory Management in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-memory-management/)

#### Real-World Use Cases
Examine practical implementations of stacks, such as undo/redo functionality and XML parsing.  
- [Undo/Redo Implementation with Stacks (Medium)](https://medium.com/swlh/undo-redo-stack-implementation-5d42cde6e7d2)  
- [Check if Tags are Balanced in XML File (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-tags-are-balanced-in-an-xml-file/)


### Real-World Use Cases
- Compilers and interpreters
- Undo/Redo operations
- Parsing nested structures like HTML/XML

## Problem-Solving Focus
Implementing the **Valid Parentheses** problem to solidify stack-based problem-solving skills.
